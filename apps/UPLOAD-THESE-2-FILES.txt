✅ I'VE DONE THE HARD WORK FOR YOU!
====================================

I created the complete files. Now just upload them to GitHub:

📁 FILES TO UPLOAD (both in your Desktop/Leaf2Root/Leaf2Root-website/apps/ folder):

1. gentle-pause.html
2. index-UPDATED.html


🚀 HOW TO UPLOAD:

Option A - Upload via GitHub Web (EASIEST):
-------------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/qwanderyanna/leaf2root-website/tree/main/apps
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag both files from your Desktop folder:
   - gentle-pause.html
   - index-UPDATED.html
4. Click "Commit changes"

⚠️ IMPORTANT: GitHub will ask about "index-UPDATED.html" - that's because the real filename should be "index.html"
   - Before committing, rename "index-UPDATED.html" to "index.html" in the upload
   - It will replace the old index.html (that's what we want!)


Option B - Use GitHub Desktop (if you have it):
------------------------------------------------
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. It should show the 2 changed files
3. Write a commit message: "Add Gentle Pause app"
4. Click "Commit to main"
5. Click "Push origin"


THAT'S IT! 🎉
Your Gentle Pause app will be live at:
